<p>Dear Ashley Chamberlain</p>

<p>We wrote to you previously about the £4320 owed to DWP.</p>
  <p>If you have already made an arrangement to pay or have contacted us to discuss your options, then
  please ignore this letter.</p>
  
<!--  <p class="mt40"><b>Breakdown of what you owe</b></p>
  
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Universal Credit overpayment &ndash; &pound;1000.00</li>
    <li>Universal Credit overpayment &ndash; &pound;920.00</li>
    <li>Universal Credit advance &ndash; &pound;2400.00</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Total amount owed: <b>&pound;4,320.00</b></p>-->
  
  <p>We understand it may not be possible to pay this in one go so you can set up a Direct Debit or
    flexible payment plan. Alternatively, you can make single payments to reduce the amount you owe.</p>
  <p>We want to help you stay in control to manage the money you owe based on what you can afford. You can pay in a way that suits you but if you are struggling you must contact us for help or we may
  take further action.</p>





<p class="mt40"><b>What you need to do next</b></p>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
  <li>Go to <a href="startThis">https://repay-manage-benefit-owed.service.gov.uk</a> (or you can search for ‘repay and
manage benefits money’ on the GOV.UK website)</li>
  <li><b>Enter security code 1314555353</b> &ndash; it is important to make a note of this as you will enter it
each time you sign in</li>
  <li>Enter your date of birth</li>
  <li>Set up a payment plan or make a payment</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, you can contact us on the number above to discuss your payment options.</p>


<p class="mt40"><b>Further action</b></p>

<p>We want to help you clear the amount you owe in a way that suits you, but it is important you act
  soon.</p>

<p>If you don't do anything by 21/08/22, we may take a number of actions including:</p>


<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>contacting your employer to make deductions from your pay (this could be up to 20%
    depending on how much you earn)</li>
  <li>asking a debt collection agency to collect this money for us</li>
</ul>
