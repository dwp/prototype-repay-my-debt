      <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">Using this service</h1>

      <p>This website is run by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings</li>
          <li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
            <li>navigate most of the website using a keyboard or speech recognition software</li>
              <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
    </ul>
      
    <p>We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>
